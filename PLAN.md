# Hevier - Workout Tracker & Suggestion App

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Build a smart workout tracker and suggester that integrates with Hevy API to analyze the last 7 days of workouts and suggest optimal routines based on push/pull/legs splits and weekly volume requirements.

**Current Stack**: 
- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- Firebase (Hosting via App Hosting, future: Firestore, Auth)
- TypeScript
- React 19

## Core Features

### 1. Hevy API Integration
- **Authentication**: API token-based authentication (personal use)  
- **Data Fetching**: Pull workout history from last 7-14 days
- **Workout Parsing**: Map Hevy exercises to reference chart categories
- **Real-time Updates**: Webhook notifications for instant workout sync ðŸ””
- **Webhook Endpoint**: `/api/webhook/hevy` receives POST notifications when workouts are completed

### 2. Workout Analysis Engine
- **Volume Tracking**: Calculate sets per week for each muscle group
- **Progress Monitoring**: Compare actual vs. target volumes from reference chart
- **Recovery Analysis**: Track workout frequency and muscle group recovery
- **Deficit Detection**: Identify undertrained muscle groups

### 3. Smart Suggestion System
- **Push/Pull/Legs Split**: Intelligent workout suggestions based on split
- **Volume Balancing**: Prioritize muscle groups with volume deficits
- **Exercise Selection**: Choose from reference chart based on STRENGTH/HYPERTROPHY tags
- **Rep Range Optimization**: Suggest appropriate rep ranges for goals

### 4. User Interface
- **Dashboard**: Weekly volume overview with progress indicators
- **Today's Workout**: AI-generated workout suggestion for current day
- **History View**: 7-day workout history with analysis
- **Settings**: Configure goals, preferences, and Hevy connection

## Technical Architecture

### Data Models

#### User Profile (Single User App)
```typescript
interface UserProfile {
  id: string;
  hevyApiToken?: string;
  preferences: {
    primaryGoal: 'STRENGTH' | 'HYPERTROPHY' | 'MIXED';
    workoutDays: number; // 3-6 days per week
    splitPreference: 'PPL' | 'UPPER_LOWER' | 'FULL_BODY';
  };
  createdAt: Date;
  lastSync: Date;
}
```

#### Workout Session
```typescript
interface WorkoutSession {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  hevyWorkoutId?: string;
  date: Date;
  type: 'PUSH' | 'PULL' | 'LEGS' | 'UPPER' | 'LOWER' | 'FULL';
  exercises: Exercise[];
  duration?: number;
  notes?: string;
}
```

#### Exercise
```typescript
interface Exercise {
  hevyExerciseId?: string;
  name: string;
  muscleGroups: MuscleGroup[];
  category: string; // From reference chart
  sets: ExerciseSet[];
}

interface ExerciseSet {
  reps: number;
  weight?: number;
  rpe?: number; // Rate of Perceived Exertion
}
```

#### Weekly Analysis
```typescript
interface WeeklyAnalysis {
  userId: string;
  weekStart: Date;
  muscleGroupVolumes: {
    [key in MuscleGroup]: {
      actualSets: number;
      targetMin: number;
      targetMax: number;
      deficit: number;
      exercises: string[];
    }
  };
  suggestions: WorkoutSuggestion[];
  overallScore: number; // 0-100
}
```

## Reference Chart Integration

The `reference_cheatsheet.json` defines:
- **Muscle Groups**: 15 categories (CHEST, BACK, SHOULDERS, etc.)
- **Weekly Targets**: Min/max sets per week for each muscle group
- **Exercise Categories**: STRENGTH (5-15 reps), HYPERTROPHY (12-30 reps), OPTIONAL
- **Exercise Examples**: Specific movements for each category

### Key Muscle Group Targets
- **High Volume**: Neck (18+ sets), Shoulders (15-21 sets), Back (12-24 sets)
- **Moderate Volume**: Chest, Biceps, Quads, Hamstrings (12-18 sets)
- **Lower Volume**: Triceps (9-15 sets), Glutes (6-12 sets), Abs (6-12 sets)

## Hevy API Integration Details

### Authentication Flow (Simplified for Personal Use)
1. User enters Hevy API token in settings
2. Token stored in environment variables or local config
3. API token used for all Hevy API requests
4. Fetch initial workout data

### Webhook Integration (Real-time Updates) ðŸ””
1. Configure webhook URL in Hevy: `https://yourapp.com/api/webhook/hevy`
2. Hevy sends POST notification when workout is completed
3. App automatically fetches new workout details
4. Re-analyzes weekly volume and updates suggestions instantly
5. User sees updated recommendations immediately

### Data Sync Strategy
- **Initial Sync**: Last 30 days of workouts
- **Regular Sync**: Check for new workouts every 6 hours
- **Incremental Updates**: Only fetch workouts since last sync
- **Backup Strategy**: Store raw Hevy data for re-processing

### Exercise Mapping
Map Hevy exercise names to reference chart categories using:
- **Exact Matching**: Direct name matches
- **Keyword Matching**: Search for key terms in exercise names
- **Manual Mapping**: User-corrected mappings stored persistently
- **AI Assistance**: Use LLM for ambiguous exercise classification
